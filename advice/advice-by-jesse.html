                When you start programming your first web app you are doing
                something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge,
                a new opportunity, and in the case of software development,
                something so specific that it's probably never been done before.
              </p>

              <p>
                Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the
                right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the
                problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that
                it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity
                awaits.

            <h2>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h2>
            <p>
              When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning
              to write your first programming language, or just the latest
              framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know
              that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't
              understand HOW exactly it's happening.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology,
              and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
            </p>

            <p>
              You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
              learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to
              train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't
              totally understand what it's doing.
